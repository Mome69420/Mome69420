💪Helping rebuild the autonomous social construct of Memecoins

📑This is where the upcoming white paper, "$Mome Paper" will be featured. In the Mome69420/Mome repo.

🔭The projects main focus is the community. Getting back to the grass roots of what memes and memecoins were, & are, all about. Built by the community, for the community

🦶Stepping away from the effortless use of A.I. Art. Featuring community creations, original art/gifs & helping bringing back creativity to the space 

👷‍♀️Working towards cNFTs & GameFi with "$Mome's Crypto Pop". A P2E game. A re-envisioning of the classic bubble pop/ brick breaker. Where you will accumulate memecoins, complete goals & even gamble, if you dare, to earn points. Which then can be converted into your favorite CNA's. cNFT integration/staking will allow for multipliers on the in-game points system

🫂Thanks for taking interest / being a memeber of the $Mome Militia! Lets embark on this journey together & together we can make it. 

Diamond Hands Unite! 💎✊
